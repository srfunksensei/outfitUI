# jQuery UI explorer

**Using Third Party javascript libraries jQuery UI implement the following**

- As a user I want to drag and drop item to specific container.
- As a user I want to delete item by dragging it outside of a container.
- As a user I am not able to drag item to container that is not appropriate for that item. (ex. I cannot place shoes inside a bed container)
- As a user I want to search by categories (autocomplete).
- As a user I have specific categories separated in accordions.
- As a user I can sort items inside specific category.
- As a user when I click on a specific item I want to know some additional info.
- As a user I want multiple panels for different types of categories.
- As a user I want to replace an item just by dragging another item over already taken container.
- As a user I want to resize item with slider which would be enabled when I place an item inside a container and when I select an item.
- As a user I want to see progress if something is taking more time than usual.
